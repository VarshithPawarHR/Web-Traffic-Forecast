# Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting

## Overview
This project uses **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** to forecast web traffic based on past trends. It takes historical session data, processes it into time sequences, and predicts future web traffic patterns.

## Features
- Loads web traffic data from a CSV file.
- Preprocesses the data using **MinMaxScaler**.
- Creates time-series sequences using a sliding window approach.
- Trains an **LSTM-based neural network** for forecasting.
- Evaluates and visualizes predictions against actual data.

## Dataset
- The dataset should contain a **'Sessions'** column representing web traffic.
- Data is **normalized** to improve model performance.

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. **Prepare Data:** Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. **Train Model:** Run the LSTM model for forecasting.
3. **Evaluate:** Generate predictions and visualize results.

Run the script:
```sh
python web_traffic_forecasting.py
```

## Model Architecture
- **2 LSTM Layers (50 units each)**
- **Dense layers for final prediction**
- **Adam optimizer & Mean Squared Error loss**

## Results
The model predicts future web traffic and visualizes actual vs. predicted values.

## Future Improvements
- Tune hyperparameters (e.g., batch size, learning rate).
- Try different sequence lengths.
- Experiment with alternative models like **Transformer-based forecasting**.
- Implementation of Hybrid model
